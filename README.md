# Draw (Manga & Illustration)

Personal repository of sketches, lineart, and colored illustrations in a **manga/animé** style.
I upload studies, poses, and pages as I practice composition, anatomy, and lighting.

## Folders
- `sketches/`: rough sketches and thumbnails.
- `ink/`: lineart / inking practice.
- `color/`: final colored pieces (digital/traditional).
- `manga-panels/`: panel/page experiments and layouts.
- `originals/` & `cleaned/`: raw scans and lightly edited versions.

## Notes
- Tools: pencil/ink, Clip Studio / Krita / Procreate (varía por pieza).
- File names: `YYYY-MM-DD_subject_style_v#.ext` for easy sorting.

## Usage / License
- Unless stated otherwise: **All Rights Reserved**. Please do not reuse without permission.
- Fan art: characters belong to their respective owners; this is non-commercial practice.
